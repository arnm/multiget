# multiget

This is a simplified version of a “download booster”, which speeds up downloads by requesting files in multiple pieces simultaneously (saturating the network), then reassembling the pieces.

# Build

Build once:
```bash
npm run build
```

Build on code change:
```bash
npm run dev-build
```

# Usage
